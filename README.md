**The model proposes. Deterministic code disposes. A human signs the exact bytes. Every step is hash-chained.**

A small, dependency-free Python library — with a language-neutral conformance
suite — for making AI-assisted work *checkable* rather than merely plausible.
It began as the ledger substrate in
[`@kernel.chat/kbot-finance`](https://github.com/isaacsight/kbot-finance) (where the AI reads an invoice
but may never post the number) and is here generalized to the places academia
is currently forced to trust a model's word:

| Wedge | The model proposes… | …the disposer is… | …and the human who signs is |
|---|---|---|---|
| `finance` | a reading of a source document | arithmetic + the bank feed | an accountant |
| `lean` | a proof | the Lean kernel | a mathematician |
| `claims` | a number in a manuscript | re-execution of the computation that produced it | the corresponding author |
| `repro` | how to reproduce a paper | actually running it, judged against tolerances | the reproducer |
| `bench` | an answer to a quantitative question | a deterministic recompute — the substrate itself, measured | — (a benchmark) |
| `review` | a peer review, with AI contribution disclosed | disclosure rules + a signed review chain | the editor |

Same primitives everywhere: canonical JSON (byte-compatible with the
TypeScript reference, including JavaScript number formatting), SHA-256
content-addressed request envelopes, HMAC-signed approval tokens bound to the
exact summary line the human read, and an append-only hash chain. Nothing in
the package reads a clock or a random source on its own; every run is a replay.

## Install

```bash
pip install provenance-substrate
```

Python ≥ 3.10, no runtime dependencies. Works offline (HPC-friendly).

## Prove it is the same substrate

The finance v1 conformance vectors are vendored. Running them is the claim:

```bash
provsub conformance finance-v1
# 143/143 passed; suite be4cdbe3e0a53bbd… manifest ok
```

The academic v1 suite (Lean, claims, repro, bench, review kinds) is generated
from this reference implementation and checked in CI:

```bash
provsub conformance academic-v1
provsub conformance --check     # regenerate in memory, diff against disk
```

Quote the `suite_hash` when you claim conformance. A port in any language that
reproduces `expected` from `input` for every vector of a kind conforms to that
kind. See [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) and
[`docs/conformance.md`](./docs/conformance.md).

## Sixty-second tour

```python
from provsubstrate.core import ContentAddressedRequest, Approver, ApprovalRequest, verify_approval, AppendOnlyAuditLog

# 1. The model's reading is a claim; the envelope is the replay key.
req = ContentAddressedRequest(
    operation="claims.verify", engine_version="claim-graph@0.1.0", schema_hash="…",
    inputs={"claim": {"value": 3.7, "unit": "s"}, "computation": {"command": ["python", "mean.py"]}},
    data_as_of="2026-08-17T00:00:00.000Z",
)
h = req.request_hash()

# 2. A deterministic disposer re-runs the computation (see provsubstrate.claims).
# 3. The human signs the exact line they read, bound to h.
summary = "Attest 1 claim: mean = 3.7 s (observed 3.7, confirmed) request " + h[:12]
tok = Approver("pi.ada", b"secret").approve(ApprovalRequest(h, summary, "session-1", "claims.attest"), "2026-08-17T12:00:00.000Z")
assert verify_approval(tok, {"pi.ada": b"secret"}, ApprovalRequest(h, summary, "session-1", "claims.attest")).ok

# 4. Everything lands in a hash chain an auditor can replay.
log = AppendOnlyAuditLog("audit.jsonl", clock=lambda: "2026-08-17T12:00:01.000Z")
log.append("approval_granted", "claims.attest", "session-1", {"request_hash": h}, approver="pi.ada")
assert log.verify().ok
```

Wedge-specific quick starts: [`docs/finance.md`](./docs/finance.md),
[`docs/lean.md`](./docs/lean.md), [`docs/claims.md`](./docs/claims.md),
[`docs/repro.md`](./docs/repro.md), [`docs/bench.md`](./docs/bench.md),
[`docs/review.md`](./docs/review.md).

## Command line and agents

```bash
provsub finance post claim.json bank.json          # stops at the gate: prints the request hash + summary line to sign
provsub lean check Basic.lean --toolchain leanprover/lean4:v4.12.0
provsub claims verify provenance-manifest.json --workdir .
provsub repro judge target.json attempt.json --workdir .
provsub bench run --responder oracle
provsub review check submission.json --chain chain.json
provsub approve --request-hash H --summary "..." --session-id S --materiality lean.record \
                --approver-id you --secret-file ~/.provsub/secret --approved-at T   # the HUMAN step; never an agent's
provsub audit verify audit.jsonl
provsub mcp                      # stdio MCP server exposing the verdict-producing operations to agents
```

Every wedge has `check`/`verify`/`judge` (verdict + the line to sign) and
`record`/`post`/`attest` (needs `--approval tok.json` from `provsub approve`
and a trust set via `--trust ID=SECRET_FILE`). Nothing reads a clock: pass
`--data-as-of`, `--now`, `--approved-at`.

The MCP server is how a model uses this: it can *request* a verdict inside an
envelope (`finance_reconcile`, `finance_prepare_post`, `lean_check`,
`lean_prepare`, `claims_verify`, `claims_badge`, `repro_judge`,
`repro_dataset_manifest`, `bench_score`, `bench_run`, `bench_taskset`,
`review_check`, `review_chain_verify`, plus the core hash and chain tools); it
cannot mint an approval, and nothing records or posts through MCP.

## What this is not

It does not make a model's claim true. It makes the claim checkable,
replayable, and signed — and it puts the model's mistakes on the record
instead of in the paper, the ledger, or the proof.

nanopublications (provenance description), C2PA (content credentials), RFC 8785
JCS (canonical JSON), Lean 4 / mathlib (the kernel as disposer). Each supplies
one piece; this package composes them into a single, conformance-tested
discipline in which a model's proposal is a first-class, hash-addressed object
that a deterministic engine must confirm and a human must sign. See
